### 🚀 The Challenge
As my first end-to-end project at the company, I spearheaded the development of this platform. The core challenge was architecting a system capable of handling a **massive, single-endpoint API** containing the entire menu structure without compromising performance.

### ✨ Key Features
- **Advanced State Management:** Successfully implemented **Redux Toolkit** for the first time to manage complex global states, cart persistence, and seamless data flow.
- **Performance Optimized Rendering:** Implemented **lazy-loading logic per section** to handle heavy data payloads, ensuring lightning-fast initial load times and reduced DOM weight.
- **Full User Journey:** Integrated secure Authentication, Profile Management, and Order History.
- **Multi-method Checkout:** Integrated **Fawaterk API** for secure online payments alongside Cash on Delivery (COD) options.
- **Dynamic Menu Logic:** Handled complex nested data structures (Sections, Items, Extras, and Prices) with a responsive UI.
- **Location & Branch Services:** Comprehensive CRUD operations for Address management and Branch/Pickup selection.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Core:** React.js
- **UI Framework:** Material UI (MUI)
- **State:** Redux Toolkit
- **Data Fetching:** Axios
- **Payments:** Fawaterk API Integration
- **Icons:** Lucide React

### 🧠 Technical Deep Dive
* **Handling the 'Massive API':** Developed custom mapping logic to efficiently process huge JSON payloads into a responsive UI without lag.
* **Architecting Redux:** Mastered Redux Toolkit on the fly to handle production-level state logic for carts and user sessions.
* **DOM Optimization:** Custom-built logic to render heavy menu items only when their parent section is active.
